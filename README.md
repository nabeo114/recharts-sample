# Recharts Sample - Bitcoin Price Chart

This project is a simple React-based application that visualizes Bitcoin price data using [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), a charting library for React. The app fetches Bitcoin price data from the CoinGecko API and displays it on an interactive area chart. Users can select different time ranges (e.g., the last 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year) and view the price changes in real-time.
